# Genie Messaging & Copy Ideas

This document contains copy suggestions for infusing the app with a playful "Genie" personality. The goal is to make the user experience more memorable and magical.

## General Tone & Voice

The Genie should be a creative partner. The tone is encouraging, powerful, and fun. It's less about "I am a servant" and more about "We're a team, and I have cosmic powers to help you create."
